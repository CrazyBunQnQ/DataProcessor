# Emerging Threats Rule Processor

The Emerging Threats Rule Processor is a Python script designed to download, process, and translate security rules from Emerging Threats repository. This software allows users to automatically download specific versions of Suricata rule sets, extract messages, and translate them into Chinese for localized threat management.

## Features

- **Download Rule Sets:** Automatically download rule sets based on user-defined versions.
- **Process Rules:** Filter and process `.rules` files containing specific keywords.
- **Translate Messages:** Utilize an external translation service to convert messages from English to Chinese.
- **Output Customization:** Generate a customized rule file with translated messages for easier integration and management.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need `requests` and `tarfile` libraries which can be installed using pip.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepository.com/emerging-threats-rule-processor.git
   cd emerging-threats-rule-processor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the script, you need to specify the version of the Suricata rules you want to download as a command-line argument:

```bash
python main.py 5.0.0
```

Replace `5.0.0` with the version number of your choice.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Download Rules:** The script first attempts to download the rules tarball from the Emerging Threats repository based on the specified version.
2. **Extract Rules:** If the download is successful, the script will extract the contents into a local directory named `rules`.
3. **Process and Translate:** The script will then process each file that includes the term `exploit` in its name, translate the relevant messages, and append them to a `csa.rules` file in the project directory.

## Customizing the Script

- To modify the rule processing or translation logic, you can edit the `process_files` function in `file_processor.py`.
- To change the translation API or its configuration, edit `translate.py`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Download Issues:** Ensure the specified version exists on the Emerging Threats website.
- **Translation Failures:** Check the API endpoint and ensure your server has internet access.
